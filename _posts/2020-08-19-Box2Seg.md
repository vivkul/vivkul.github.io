#### Here we present our work on [<font color="#3498DB">Box2Seg: Attention Weighted Loss and Discriminative Feature Learning for Weakly Supervised Segmentation</font>](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg/publications/2020/box2seg.pdf){:target="_blank"} where we call our model Box2Seg. This work got accepted in ECCV-2020. In this work we focus on weakly supervised semantic segmentation where we propose an approach using only bounding box annotations during training time..

#### We treat bounding boxes as noisy labels for the foreground objects. Hence, we predict a per-class attention map that saliently guides the per-pixel cross entropy loss to focus on foreground pixels and refines the segmentation boundaries. This avoids propagating erroneous gradients due to incorrect foreground labels on the background.

#### Additionally, we learn pixel embeddings to simultaneously optimize for high intra-class feature affinity (n) while increasing discrimination (n) between features (n) across different (n) classes.

#### Our method, Box2Seg, achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2012. Our weakly supervised approach is comparable to the recent fully supervised methods. 

#### Qualitative results and ablation studies show the benefit of different loss terms on the overall performance.
