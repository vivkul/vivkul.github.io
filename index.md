<h4>I am interested in the field of machine learning. Specifically, deep learning models and bayesian inference interest me. I am currently working as a Research Fellow with Dr. Sundararajan Sellamanickam at Microsoft Research India. Prior to that, I was doing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Indian Institute of Technology with Professor Vinay Namboodiri and Professor Harish Karnick as advisors. During undergrad, I did internships in Machine Learning and Statistics group of Xerox Research Centre India.</h4>
