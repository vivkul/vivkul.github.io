#### I am interested in the field of machine learning. Specifically, deep learning models and bayesian inference interest me. I am currently working as a Research Fellow with Dr. Sundararajan Sellamanickam at [<font color="#3498DB">Microsoft Research India</font>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I was doing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [<font color="#3498DB">Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur</font>](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} with Professor Vinay Namboodiri and Professor Harish Karnick as advisors. During undergrad, I did internship in [<font color="#3498DB">Machine Learning and Statistics</font>](http://www.xrci.xerox.com/data-analytics/machine-learning-and-statistics){:target="_blank"} group of Xerox Research Centre India.
